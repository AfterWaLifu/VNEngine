______________________________________

For development vcpkg (with global settings) is used
All the libs (as posible) is x64 and static

Libs needed (API not included):
*	SDL2
*	(for Windows it includes ALL the libs used by SDL2, because of static linking)
*	SDL_image (not yet needed, planed)
*	ImGui (probably some commits may use it as for debuging/testing features)
*	OpenAL - audio api
*	sndfile - small lib to read audio files
*	*to be added*
